# Medicine-Drugs-Data-Analysis

Project Overview

This repository contains a SQL-based analysis of medicine dataset. The analysis aims to provide insights into various aspects of the dataset, including medicine categories, dosage forms, and manufacturer distribution, as well as patterns in the classification of medicines as prescription or over-the-counter.

Dataset Description

The dataset used for the analysis consists of several key features related to different medicines. Below is an overview of the dataset columns:

Name: The synthetic name of the medicine.

Category: The therapeutic category of the medicine.

Dosage Form: The form in which the medicine is administered (e.g., tablet, injection).

Strength: The dosage strength of the medicine.

Manufacturer: The name of the pharmaceutical manufacturer.

Indication: The medical condition or indication for which the medicine is prescribed.

Classification: Specifies whether the medicine is available by prescription (P) or over-the-counter (OTC).

Objective of the Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to derive meaningful insights from the medicine dataset using SQL queries. Specific focus areas include:

1. Distribution of medicines across various therapeutic categories.
2. The most common dosage forms and dosage strengths for each category.
3. Analysis of the top manufacturers and their product distribution.
4. Classification of medicines into prescription vs. over-the-counter categories and patterns within this classification.
5. Trends in medicine indications based on the dataset.

Analysis Overview

The analysis was performed using SQL, and the repository contains the following key components:

SQL Queries: All SQL scripts used for querying and analyzing the data. Each query is designed to answer specific questions about the dataset (e.g., which manufacturer produces the most medicines in a given category, which dosage forms are most common, etc.).

Queries Report: This report shows the result of each query.

Key queries include:

1. Dosage form and strength analysis.
2. Manufacturer distribution and frequency.
3. Prescription vs. OTC classification analysis.
4. Analysis of therapeutic categories.


How to Use Dataset: The dataset is available in the repository as medicine_dataset.csv.

SQL Scripts: The SQL scripts used for the analysis are located in the Query folder.

Running Queries: You can run these queries on any SQL platform such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. Ensure the dataset is loaded into your database before running the queries.
